Paired Programming Example Interview 

## Purpose 

Repo is used to demostrate an example pair programming interview that could be useable in the DevOps Space.

## Tools Used

You will need some familiarity with the following:

* Python 
* Django
* Terraform
* Kubernetes
* Google Cloud Platform
* Docker
* HTML
* CSS
* ChatGPT

Yes I've included ChatGPT as I've used it for 90% of the additional code used out of the main skeleton provided by Django in [this repo](https://github.com/wsvincent/djangoforbeginners/tree/main/ch11-user-authentication).  DevOps is so broad so its hard to memorize everything possible and ChatGPT, while not perfect, gets me about 90% where I want to go while also teaching me at the same time.  You still have to **know** *where* and *what* to copy and paste.  And *how* to connect all the dots to make it work.
